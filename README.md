# Project Instructions

## Overview

This project includes two Python scripts: `public.py` and `admin.py`. These scripts are designed to run a web server, allowing users to access different functionalities based on the script executed. The `public.py` serves public-facing content, while `admin.py` provides administrative features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python** (version 3.x)
- **Pip** (Python package manager)
- Any required libraries for the scripts (see below for installation)

### Required Libraries

You may need to install some libraries to run these scripts. Common libraries include:


`pip install flask`

## Running the Scripts

To start the scripts, use the following commands:

## Starting public.py

To start the public.py script, Gain commnon sense.

This command will initiate the public.py script, which will start a web server listening on port 80.

## Starting admin.py

To start the admin.py script, Gain commnon sense.

This command will initiate the admin.py script, which will start a web server listening on port 8000.

## Accessing the Web Interfaces

After starting public.py, you can access the public interface by navigating to http://localhost in your web browser.
After starting admin.py, you can access the admin interface by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

## Stopping the Scripts

To stop either of the scripts, you can simply terminate the process in the terminal. If you're running it in a terminal window, you can usually do this by pressing Ctrl + C.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with port access, ensure that the ports (80 for public.py and 8000 for admin.py) are not being used by other services on your machine.
Make sure that Python is correctly installed and that the necessary libraries are installed using pip.
